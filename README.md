## Prerequisites

The results cited in the manuscript were derived using the **D**am
**A**dult **B**ranch **O**ccupancy **M**odel (DABOM). `DABOM` is an R
package for estimating abundance of anadromous fishes using fish tagged
at a primary sampling facility (e.g., dam) and later detected in
upstream tributaries. It incorporates the branching structure of a
stream network, and simultaneously estiamtes imprefect detection
probabilities at all detection locations and movement probabilities past
detection locations. The movement probabilities, when multiplied
correctly and combined with an estimate of total abundance at the
tagging site, can be used to estimate abundance at a variety of spatial
scales.

To install `DABOM` you can use Hadley Wickhamâ€™s `devtools` package. To
install and load the `devtools` package use:

    install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)

NOTE: To use `devtools`, you may also have to download and install
Rtools (although it may already be installed). The latest version on
Rtools can be found at <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>

Once `devtools` is successfully installed, use the following to install
DABOM from GitHub:

    devtools::install_github("KevinSee/DABOM@v0.1.0")

DABOM requires the JAGS software (**J**ust **A**nother **G**ibbs
**S**ampler). This can be downloaded here:

<https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/>

Please download version \>= 4.0.0
